Crossref - A ruby way to work with DOI metadata from crossref.org

You can get info on many academic articles via DOI. 
This gem gets XML from crossref and gives you a nice ruby object to work with.

Requires nokogiri

Example:

>> require 'crossref'
=> true
>> paper = Crossref::Metadata.new('10.1021/ie50324a027')
...
>> paper.title
=> "Heat Transfer and Pressure Drop of Liquids in Tubes"
>> paper.authors
=> [{:surname=>"Sieder", :given_name=>"E. N."}, {:surname=>"Tate", :given_name=>"G. E."}]
>> paper.journal
=> {:title=>"Industrial & Engineering Chemistry"}
